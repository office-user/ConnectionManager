# Oracle Identity Manager (OIM) Platform Utility

## Overview
This project provides a utility class for interacting with Oracle Identity Manager (OIM) and associated databases. It includes methods for establishing OIM connections, retrieving OIM services, and creating database connections.

## Files
1. `Platform.java`: The main utility class containing methods for OIM and database operations.
2. `PlatformTest.java`: A test class demonstrating the usage of the `Platform` class.

## Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Oracle Identity Manager libraries
- Oracle JDBC driver
- Properly configured OIM environment

## Configuration
Before using the `Platform` class, you need to configure the following constants in `Platform.java`:

- `AUTH_WL_LOCATION`: Path to the authentication file
- `T3_URL`: OIM server URL
- `OIM_USERNAME`: OIM login username
- `OIM_PASSWORD`: OIM login password
- `DB_URL`: Database URL
- `DB_USERNAME`: Database username
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password

Replace the `#` placeholders with your actual values.

## Usage

### Establishing an OIM Connection
```java
OIMClient oimClient = Platform.getOIMConnection();
// Use the oimClient
// Don't forget to close the connection when done
oimClient.logout();
```

### Retrieving an OIM Service
```java
OIMClient oimClient = Platform.getOIMConnection();
UserManager userManager = Platform.getService(oimClient, UserManager.class);
// Use the userManager
// Don't forget to close the OIM connection when done
oimClient.logout();
```

### Creating a Database Connection
```java
Connection conn = Platform.getDatabaseConnection();
// Use the database connection
// Don't forget to close the connection when done
conn.close();
```

## Testing
The `PlatformTest` class provides examples of how to use the `Platform` class methods and properly manage connections. To run the tests:

1. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac Platform.java PlatformTest.java
   ```
2. Run the test class:
   ```
   java PlatformTest
   ```

## Important Notes
- Always close connections (OIMClient and database) after use to prevent resource leaks.
- Handle exceptions appropriately in your application.
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to connect to the OIM server and database.
- This code is for demonstration purposes and may need to be adapted for production use, particularly in terms of security and error handling.

## Logging
The code uses Java's built-in logging (java.util.logging). Log messages are generated for significant events and errors, which can help in debugging and monitoring.

## Customization
You can extend the `Platform` class or modify the existing methods to suit your specific needs. For example, you might want to add more specific OIM operations or additional database functionality.

## Security Considerations
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like passwords in the code. Consider using environment variables or secure configuration files.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization in a production environment.
- Use prepared statements for any SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
